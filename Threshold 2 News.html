    <h1>Call of Duty 4 Remastered</h1>
    
    <p>
    The long awaited Call of Duty 4 remaster is almost on our doorstep, Jack has been lucky enough to recieve early access priveledges and has given us some juicy details!

    It almost seemed impossible that Call of Duty would ever return to boots on the ground gameplay, let alone remastering arguably the best title in the series. This announcement sent fans around the world wild. Being a Call of Duty veteran, I jumped at the opportunity to try out the game early, and boy was I impressed! The visuals are thrilling, they've done a really good job not to overdo them. The missions leave me with the same feeling I had when I was 12 years old first playing them. Everything is the same as before, just slightly more modern and polished. Let's hope that this gives the developers a wake up call and helps them to realise that people don't want futuristic games anymore.
